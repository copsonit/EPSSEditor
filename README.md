# EPSSEditor
Create Sample Patch Information (SPI) files for EPSS in Windows. EPSS is Enhanced Polyphonic Sample Synthesizer for Atari STe/Falcon/TT created in the nineties by Unit Seventeen and Copson Data. 2018 an free Atari Community Version of E.P.S.S. for the Atari was released and you can find at http://epss.copson.se. 

The idea of EPSS Editor for Windows is to make it possible to create the SPI files for E.P.S.S. on the PC instead of inside E.P.S.S. on the Atari. Advantages to this might be that you have the samples on a PC or want to do some conversion or sound change of them on the PC and it might be difficult to copy them back and forth between the PC and the Atari. Also native E.P.S.S. on the Atari might not support the sound format you want.

Currently it is just a development project and I have not built any installation or even an executable for it, so you have to download the free Visual Studio Community C# version at https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/  and download the code and compile it yourself! ;)
